# Desert Bike

^ Little dumb homage to Desert Bus.

## LED visualizer program

Accepts input via 3 switches and a potentiometer.  Outputs to a strip of Neopixel '2812' LEDS.  First run of the bike is @ 286 or something?  Basically enough to cover the fork both sides, top/seat/down tubes both sides, and the seat stay both sides.  Skipped the chainstay b/c I was using a coaster brake for this bike and it needs a little clamp thing on one side to hold the brake arm.  Still looks good, sort of matches the fork angle in the front.

## Interface

* **Up** button - Short press: program up, Long press: jump to pending / silent mode
* **Down** button - Short press: program change down, Long press: jump to parked mode
* **Remote** switch on/off 1x - "Find my Bike" mode, which then goes back to parking mode
* **Potentiometer - I implemented this as 'intensity' knob -- animations get crazyier towards the right side, more chill to the left side.
